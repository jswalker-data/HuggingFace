# 🤖 Hugging Face – AI Agents Course

This repository contains my notes, experiments, and implementations based on the [AI Agents course](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course) by Hugging Face.

---

## 📚 Course Overview

The course covers how to build autonomous AI agents using:

- 🧠 Language models
- 🧰 Tools (e.g., web search, file systems)
- ⚙️ Planning strategies and execution
- 🧵 Memory and agent chaining

---

## 📁 Structure

Each section of the course will have its own folder with:

- Jupyter notebooks
- Notes and markdowns
- Experimentation and outputs

---

## 🚧 Status

This is a **work in progress** as I work through the course step-by-step and implement each concept with practical code examples.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Code examples will primarily use Python and Hugging Face's `transformers`, `agents`, and `datasets` libraries.
- Dependencies will be documented per section.
